## Overview
This project is a **personal project** developed as part of the **SOLVD Laba Node.js training**.

It is a backend API that allows you to manage resources for an online clothing store, including products, categories, and available sizes. Customers can search for clothing items by size and category, and the API returns a list of matching products.

**Present limitations:**

- The API is not deployed yet, so it must be run locally.

- Management of products (adding, editing, and deleting) is a planned feature and will be implemented in future steps.
